# bowling kata

The goal of this kata is to compute the score of a bowling game.

As an __input__, we'll receive the number of pins knocked down for each roll. 
For this kata, we'll assume that the input is valid (no check needed).

As an __output__, we'll compute the score for the 10 frames.



For details about bowling rules and how to compute the score, please have a look at:

In order to help you designing the examples (tests), here is a bowling score calculator:

*Be aware that although the number of frames is always 10, the number of rolls can be different depending of the combination of pins knocked down (spare / strike). The number of rolls can vary between 12 and 21.*
